# NOTE: For Docker deployment, only database configuration is needed
# All other settings are managed through the encrypted web interface

# Database Configuration (only required for Docker deployment)
# The Docker deployment script generates random secure credentials automatically
# Uncomment and modify only if you want to use external PostgreSQL database

# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database

# For Replit deployment, database is automatically configured
# All application configuration (Apache Answer, Slack) is managed through the web UI
