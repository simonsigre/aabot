# Socket Mode Success - AABot Working!

## Resolution Summary

**Date**: August 2, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - AABot fully operational

## The Fix

The "dispatch_failed" error was caused by using the wrong event name in the Socket Mode client.

**Incorrect**: `socketModeClient.on('slash_command', ...)`  
**Correct**: `socketModeClient.on('slash_commands', ...)`

## Key Implementation Details

```javascript
// Correct Socket Mode implementation
socketModeClient.on('slash_commands', async ({ ack, body, context }) => {
  try {
    // Acknowledge immediately with empty response
    await ack({});
    
    // Process command asynchronously
    setImmediate(() => {
      this.handleSlashCommand(body).catch(error => {
        console.error('[SOCKET] Error in async command handler:', error);
      });
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('[SOCKET] Error in slash command acknowledgment:', error);
  }
});
```

## Verification

Command tested successfully:
```
/aabot-search test
```

Results:
- ✅ Command received by Socket Mode client
- ✅ Acknowledged within 3 seconds
- ✅ Apache Answer API searched successfully
- ✅ 10 results returned to Slack
- ✅ No dispatch_failed errors

## Architecture Confirmed

AABot is now fully operational with:
- Socket Mode WebSocket connection ✅
- Official @slack/socket-mode SDK ✅
- Proper event acknowledgment pattern ✅
- Apache Answer API integration ✅
- PostgreSQL logging ✅
- Real-time web dashboard ✅

The system is production-ready and working as designed.
